# Nim URL Shortener

<!-- Don't forget to add your badges (License, CI, Code coverage) -->

**Nim URL Shortener** is a web application that allows you to do shorten an URL - similar to popular services like [bit.ly](https://bitly.com/) or [TinyURL](https://tinyurl.com/).

This is a learning project to improve my knowledge of **[Nim][nim]**.

_Note:_ Heroku nuked my free live demo because somebody misused it. Currently I don't plan to redeploy it.  
If you are interested in this application, you can run it locally if you have Docker-Compose installed.

## Built With

- [Nim][nim]
- [Jester][jester]

## Installation

The project uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Developed on a Linux machine.

- docker-compose version 1.25.2
- Docker version 19.03

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sophiabrandt/NimUrlShortener.git
```

## Usage

Move into the cloned folder and spin up the docker containers:

```bash
cd NimUrlShortener
docker-compose up --build
```

Visit `http://localhost:5001` in your browser.

### Tests

Start the docker containers in the background, then run the test with `nimble`:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec url-shortener nimble c -r tests/database_test
```
